BioAlchemy is a set of Python SQLAlchemy mappings for common bioinformatics
file formats. The goal of BioAlchemy is to make it easier to load, extract and
interact with these formats from SQLAlchemy-compatible databases.

## Installation

The BioAlchemy package can be installed by simply running

```bash
pip install .
```

This requires either a working internet connection or an up-to-date copy of SQLAlchemy.
